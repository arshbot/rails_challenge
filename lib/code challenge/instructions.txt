Code Challenge Instructions

This challenge will give us an idea about your coding skills. Don't worry if you can't finish all requirements in time. Just tell us how you would proceed.

We're using Rails 4, RSpec 3.5 etc.

In the `csv` folder you find some data files.

## Tasks

- Crate a new rails application (you can use sqlite or postgresql as your database engine)
- Update the README inside with information on how to work with it if you think that some information might be helpful
- Set up an appropriate data model for the data in the csv files

- Create rake tasks to import the data in the csv files into the database (make sure to set the proper data associations)

- Create a simple controller/view to show the list of people who attended an event (selecting an even should display the people who attended)

- Create a simple REST API endpoint that returns a list of people as json. No authentication/authorization is needed here.
